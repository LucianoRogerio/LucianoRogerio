I am agronomist graduated from the College of Agronomy and Veterinary of Santa Catarina State ([UDESC](https://www.udesc.br/cav)). I got my Master and Ph.D. Degree in Genetics and Breeding at the Federal University of Viçosa ([UFV](http://www.posgenetica.ufv.br/eng/)). I discovered my passion for plant breeding early at my under graduation during my genetics classes, which give me the opportunity to work as a volunteer in IMEGEM Institute (Institute of Breeding and Molecular Genetics) of UDESC.

At IMEGEM, I was responsible to perform visual mass selection in segregating populations of common beans (*Phaseolus vulgaris* Link), carrying out activities of the bank of germplasm, and for farm and experimental design activities. During my last three months of my under graduation, I assisted the Researcher [Alfredo do Nascimento Júnior](https://www.embrapa.br/en/team/-/empregado/298803/alfredo-do-nascimento-junior) of [EMBRAPA Wheat](https://www.embrapa.br/en/trigo) at Triticale, oat, and rye breeding program. In EMBRAPA I performed controlled crosses in triticale, and performed visual mass selection on S2:4 populations.

I moved to Viçosa - MG, to pursuit my dream of becoming a classical plant breeder, and also to start my Master in plant breeding. Federal University of Viçosa gave me several opportunities of study, international contacts, and friendships, which I embraced as much as I could. In one of this opportunities I moved to Piracicaba to work with Professor [Roberto Fritsche-Neto](https://www.irri.org/about-us/our-people/roberto-fritsche-neto) at the maize breeding of the Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture of the University of São Paulo.
