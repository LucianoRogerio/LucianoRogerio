title: "Early selection in segregating common bean plants for resistance to bacterial wilt"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2012-11-07-paper-Morais.html
excerpt: 'The objective of this study were both the estimation of the efficiency of selection in segregating populations of common bean for the resistance to Curtobacterium and also the indication of the best time of the cycle to make the selection of resistant plants. To this end, we used converging crosses between IAC-Carioca Aruã x SCS Guará, IACCarioca Pyatã x IAC-Carioca and SCS Guará x Pérola, originating filial generations (F1, F2, F2:3 and F3:4) which were subsequently inoculated with *Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. Flaccumfaciens*, isolate 2634, and evaluated according to a scale related to the common symptoms of the disease at 20, 40 and 60 days after inoculation. The results showed that the segregating generations of Aruã x Guará, Pyatã x Guará and Pyatã x Pérola had similar behavior in relation to resistance to the Curtobacterium symptoms. The selection is effective for the coming generations of Aruã x Guará and Pyatã x Pérola and the favorable time for distinguishing and selecting reliably segregating plants occurs between 40 and 60 days after inoculation.'
